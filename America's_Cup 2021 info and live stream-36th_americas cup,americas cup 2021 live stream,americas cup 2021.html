Or, if you're new to the sport, now is the perfect time to learn all about the exciting things that are to come. So, without further ado, let's explore what the America's Cup is all about and where you can watch the America's Cup 2021 live stream.</p><p><br></p><p><u>History of the sport</u></p><p>The America's Cup (or Auld Mug to those in the know) is a historic yachting race that typically takes place every three to four years. It is the oldest international sporting trophy, having been founded in 1851, and still carries with it a delightful charm as old as the sport itself. Rather like knights challenging one another to a duel, the America's Cup takes place when a defender (the yacht club that won the Cup during the previous competition) is challenged by a challenger (the yacht club hoping to secure the Cup).</p><p><br></p><p>Nowadays, the sport is not only appreciated for the exciting prospect of defender vs challenger, but also due to the impressive yachts that are specifically designed for the event. The prestige of the sport attracts some of the worlds most impressive sailors and designers, all hoping to help in the fight for the illustrious Cup. The Yacht Club that reaches seven points across the multiple races is declared the winner, and the America's Cup will either remain in the defender's hands, or else be passed on to the victorious challenger.</p><p><br></p><p><u>Previous Years Results</u></p><p>So, we have looked at the history of the sport (albeit briefly, there is a lot of fascinating facts about the America's Cup, and it is certainly worth checking out) but let's explore the most recent event. The 35th America's Cup took place in 2017 and provided some exciting sporting action when the challenger, Emirates Team New Zealand, beat the defender, Oracle Team USA, by an impressive 7-1. As such, Emirates Team New Zealand claimed the America's Cup for themselves and will take on the role of defender during the 36th America's Cup competition. If the last America's Cup is anything to go by, then the America's Cup 2021 is shaping up to be yet another exciting competition.</p><p><br></p><p><u>What can we expect from the coming event? </u></p><p>As mentioned above, the defender this time will be Emirates Team New Zealand, who are likely desperate to keep hold of the America's Cup. It won't be made easy by the challengers, however, who will be just as determined to take the Cup home with them. Although the challenger will not be decided until the conclusion of the PRADA Cup, the Challenger Selector Series, they are sure to put up a fight given that they will emerge fresh off a victory and hungry for the America's Cup 2021. The event will take place in Auckland, New Zealand, with two races planned per day scheduled for March 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15, with reserve days already in place until March 21st in case of extenuating circumstances. The winner will be the first to reach seven points across all of the races, and is sure to be an exciting event.</p><p><br></p><p><u>How can I watch?</u></p><p>The dates listed above are the projected dates for the races to take place, however, be sure to keep up to date with any competition news in case the races are postponed. If all goes to plan with the weather though, we can expect to see two races per day on the aforementioned dates. So, how can I watch?</p><p><br></p><p>Surely the most impressive way, for those in the Auckland area, or those avid fans willing to travel, is to see the event live in person in Auckland, New Zealand. There are, however, five courses planned in different locations so that the race management team can decide each day where the event should take place based on weather conditions. That said, it is best to check the official website for information on the day, but if you're in the area you should be sure to check it out!</p><p><br></p><p>For those otherwise-located fans however, there is still good news! The event will be covered live by several different networks and broadcasters worldwide. Check your local network to ensure that they will be covering the event. For those in the USA, the America's Cup 2021 live stream will be covered on NBC Sports Network (for those with a cable subscription). It is unlikely that the America's Cup 2021 live stream will be available for free given that NBC have paid for the right to coverage, however this is something that may be available closer to the time on social media sites such as YouTube or Facebook. Race days have a projected race window of between 16:00 and 18:00 local time in Auckland, New Zealand, so be sure to check your time zone to guarantee that you don't miss any of the action! The 36th America's Cup is looking exciting, so be sure to tune in!</p>
